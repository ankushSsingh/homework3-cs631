Threshold Values for the experiments are recorded as :

DA1 - 50.14
DA2 - 0.235
SA1 - 0.229
SA2 - 0.03
SA3 - 0.0012 


#For running the codes for one given scenario (say sa1), go to the directory (sa1) and enter the command:-

$python train_sa1.py

The output will be three graphs corresponding to the orignal sensor readings, scree-plot and departure scores respectively. The program outputs on the screen the obtained threshold for the case
